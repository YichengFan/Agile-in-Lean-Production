    "## 1. Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance understanding and practical application of Lean Production principles, this simulation system is built using LEGO as a physical abstraction. Although not based on a real-world factory floor, by decomposing the production flow, assigning teams, and simulating material and information flow, we aim to replicate key variables and types of waste (e.g., waiting, transportation, inventory) in manufacturing and use the simulation for performance assessment and continuous improvement.\n",

    "# LEGO Lean Simulation – Environment Definition\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This repository defines the **simulation environment** for the LEGO Lean Production project.\n",
    "The goal of the simulation is to model the full process flow of assembling LEGO ski gliders, from raw bricks to sold products, following lean manufacturing principles.\n",

    "The `environment.py` file (converted from the Excel sheets) will store all parameters, object definitions, and process logic required for the simulation.\n",

    "## Key Assumptions\n",
    "- **Deterministic environment:** all processing times are fixed (no randomness in Sprint-1).\n",
    "- **One worker per team:** workers cannot process and deliver simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Batch size = 1:** each station handles one unit at a time.\n",
    "- **Push production strategy:** stations start work as soon as materials are available.\n",
    "- **No switching cost** or setup time for color changes (to be added in later sprints).\n",
    "- **Simplified timing rule:** 1 brick = 1 second of work time.\n",

    "## Purpose of Environment File\n",
    "`environment.py` will:\n",
    "1. Store all parameter values and object lists.\n",
    "2. Define the connections between stations (flow rules).\n",
    "3. Provide global constants to initialize the simulation."
