    "## 1. Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance understanding and practical application of Lean Production principles, this simulation system is built using LEGO as a physical abstraction. Although not based on a real-world factory floor, by decomposing the production flow, assigning teams, and simulating material and information flow, we aim to replicate key variables and types of waste (e.g., waiting, transportation, inventory) in manufacturing and use the simulation for performance assessment and continuous improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an abstract but functional model of a lean production system  \n",
    "- Implement a simulation engine using Python (or R) with interactive execution  \n",
    "- Allow configurable inputs and random events to test various lean strategies  \n",
    "- Support iterative experiments for comparison and optimization  \n",
