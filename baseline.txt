Baseline Model (Core Logic Only)
1) Flow and Stations
Single push line, deterministic routing, single product.
Sequence:
S1 (Type Sorting, raw mixed parts from A) → B (sorted parts) →
S2 (Kit Build) → C1/C2/C3 (kits) →
S3 (Axis Assembly, C1→D1), S4 (Chassis Assembly, C2→D2) →
S5 (Final Assembly, D1 + D2 + C3 → E).
Buffers: A (raw), B (sorted), C1/C2/C3 (kits), D1/D2 (subassemblies), E (finished). Large or infinite capacity.
2) BOM (deterministic)
S1 consumes a fixed BOM from A and outputs the same items into B (classification).
S2 consumes the same BOM from B and outputs: C1: bun01, C2: bun02, C3: bun03 (one kit each).
S3: consumes bun01 → outputs D1: saa01.
S4: consumes bun02 → outputs D2: sac01.
S5: consumes bun03 + saa01 + sac01 → outputs E: fg01.
(Use the default quantities defined in env.py; no probabilistic splits.)
3) Timing and Resources
One team per station; workers as default (S1=2, S2=2, S3=2, S4=2, S5=3).
Processing time: default triangular distributions per station; transport times as default.
No randomness: deterministic processing, missing_brick_prob = 0, defects off if needed.
4) Shift and Control
Single shift 08:00–16:00 (as in default config).
Push release: release a given number of orders at t=0 to source S1.
5) KPIs to check
Throughput (θ), WIP, Lead time (Little’s Law consistency), Utilization, Buffer levels.
Aim: confirm base logic correctness, not optimization.
6) What is excluded for the baseline
Probabilistic routing, dynamic routing, CONWIP/advanced WIP control, random disruptions, defects/rework, cost/profit accounting, assembly trace export, extra logging.
